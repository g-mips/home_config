# Directories

- `config` -- All `.config` files that need no configuration live in their folders under this directory.
- `config_config` -- All `.config` files that need configuration live in their folders under this directory.
- `extras` -- All extra files that are needed by the configuration scripts in `config_config` that the Makefile shouldn't know about.
- `home` -- All dot files that live in the home directory.
- `local` -- All `.local` files live here.
- `old` -- All crusty unused files go here that I'm not willing to delete quite yet.
