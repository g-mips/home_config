# Prerequisites:
Install `bash-completion` and `sed` before install

# Installation:
Run `./configure.sh` and decide what features you want included. Then run `make`.
If you make adjustments to some files, you may have to rerun `./configure.sh`
but for sure `make`. For a clean build run `make clean`. Running that will require
running `./configure.sh` again.

# Usage:
Close current terminal and reopen to get all the features desired.
